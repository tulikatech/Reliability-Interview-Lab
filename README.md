# Reliability Interview Lab (RIL)

A compact, high-signal landing page for **Reliability Interview Lab** — a premium 1:1 advisory for career switchers preparing for SRE / DevOps / Cloud interviews.

This repository contains the public-facing website only.
It is intentionally minimal, fast, and focused on clarity over marketing noise.

### 🌐 Live Site
👉 **[https://tulikatech.github.io/Reliability-Interview-Lab/](https://tulikatech.github.io/Reliability-Interview-Lab/)**

## 🎯 Purpose
Reliability Interview Lab exists to solve a specific problem:
> **Strong technical candidates failing recruiter screens and interviews due to low signal, not lack of skill.**

This site communicates:
*   What the advisory is (and is not)
*   Who it’s for
*   How the process works
*   How to apply

No funnels. No content marketing. No hype.

---

## 🧭 What This Is (and Isn’t)

**This is**
*   ✅ A private, 1:1 advisory (not group coaching)
*   ✅ Focused on resume signal, interview narrative, and drill-based prep
*   ✅ Built from real hiring-panel and interview-loop experience
*   ✅ Designed to filter out poor-fit candidates early

**This is not**
*   ❌ Interview coaching at scale
*   ❌ Resume rewriting as a standalone service
*   ❌ A guaranteed-offer program
*   ❌ A public personal brand site

---

## 🧩 Site Structure
The landing page flows logically to build trust before offering engagement options:

1.  **Hero**
    *   Pure value proposition and positioning (no complex layouts).
    *   Primary "Apply" CTA and secondary "What you get" anchor.
2.  **How It Works**
    *   A linear, 4-step process: **Audit** → **Rebuild** → **Drill** → **Final pass**.
3.  **What You Get**
    *   Detailed deliverables (Resume, Stories, Drills) and audience filters.
4.  **Ways to Work Together**
    *   Transparent, consultant-style menu of engagement options.
5.  **FAQ**
    *   Key objections answered transparently.

This structure is optimized for **clarity and conversion**, not scroll depth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **HTML5** (semantic, accessible)
*   **Vanilla CSS** (custom properties, grid/flex layouts)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (minimal interactivity only)
*   No frameworks
*   No trackers
*   No client-side analytics

**Design principles:**
*   Dark, high-contrast theme (Palette C: Monochrome + Redline)
*   Thin borders, no glassmorphism
*   System-first performance mindset

## 🧠 Design & Copy Philosophy
*   Mechanism-driven language (*screens, skims, signals*)
*   Avoids buzzwords: *empower, journey, unlock*
*   Confidence without overpromising

*   Copy optimized for **engineers and hiring managers**, not influencers

---

*   No user data is collected on the site
*   Applications are handled via Google Forms
*   No resumes or sensitive documents are stored unless explicitly submitted by the applicant
*   No fake profiles, proxy interviews, or misrepresentation are supported

---
